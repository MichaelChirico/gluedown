#' @title Markdown tables (4.10 extension)
#' @description Wraps around the [knitr::kable()] function to turn an `R` object,
#' typically a data frame or matrix, into a single
#' @details FM enables the `table` extension, where an additional leaf block
#'   type is available.
#'
#'   A table is an arrangement of data with rows and columns, consisting of a
#'   single header row, a delimiter row separating the header from the data, and
#'   zero or more data rows.
#'
#'   Each row consists of cells containing arbitrary text, in which
#'   [inlines](https://github.github.com/gfm/#inline) are parsed, separated by
#'   pipes (`|`). A leading and trailing pipe is also recommended for clarity of
#'   reading, and if thereâ€™s otherwise parsing ambiguity. Spaces between pipes
#'   and cell content are trimmed. Block-level elements cannot be inserted in a
#'   table.
#'
#'   The delimiter row consists of cells whose only content are hyphens (`-`),
#'   and optionally, a leading or trailing colon (`:`), or both, to indicate
#'   left, right, or center alignment respectively (see `align` in
#'   [knitr::kable()]).
#' @param x An `R` object to be formatted as table.
#' @param ... Arguments passed to [knitr::kable()]
#' @return A `glue` vector of length one, with each element or row of `x`
#'  separated by a newline.
