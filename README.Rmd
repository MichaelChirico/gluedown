The `gluedown` helps transition from R vectors to markdown text. The functions
use [`glue()`][glue] to wrap character vectors in markdown syntax. This allows
users to directly print R vectors as markdown text for improved clarity and
readability. Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text markup language prevalent in
the R community.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kiernann/gluedown")
```

## Usage

By default, many `gluedown` functions simply take a character vector and return
that same vector with each element wrapped in the appropriate markdown syntax.

With the `cat` argument, these wrapped vectors can be easily concatenated,
separated with a newline, and printed; this is useful in combination with the
`results='asis'` [R Markdown][rmd] chunk option to directly print markdown
blocks.

```{r prepare, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gluedown)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

### Lists

Printing vectors as markdown lists was the initial inspiration for the package.
Here, we also see how _inline_ functions can be used within _block_ functions.

```{r ex_list, results='asis'}
md_list(state.name[1:3], cat = TRUE)
```

```{r ex_others, results='asis'}
inlines <- c(
  md_bold(state.name[4]),
  md_code(state.name[5]),
  md_link(state.name[6], "https://Colorado.gov"),
  md_italic(state.name[7]),
  md_strike(state.name[8])
)

md_bullet(inlines, cat = TRUE)
```

### Pipes

All functions are designed to fit within the tidyverse ecosystem by working with
[pipes][pipe].

```{r ex_quote, results='asis'}
read_html("https://w.wiki/A58") %>% 
  html_node("blockquote") %>% 
  html_text(trim = TRUE) %>% 
  str_remove("\\[(.*)\\]") %>% 
  md_quote(cat = TRUE)
```

[pipe]: https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html

### Extensions

The package primarily uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm] (GFM), a
site-specific version of the [CommonMark specification][cm], an unambiguous
improvement on John Gruber's [original Markdown][df]. With this flavor, some
useful extensions like [task lists][task] are supported on GitHub. Elsewhere,
there may not work as well (or at all).

```{r ex_task, results='asis'}
legislation <- c("Houses passes", "Senate concurs", "President signs")
md_task(legislation, check = 1:2, cat = TRUE)
```

Some features aren't technically supported by GFM, but can be 
[forced by pandoc][pandoc]. With `md_define()`, definition lists are simply
rendered as funky bullet lists on GitHub.

```{r ex_define, results='asis'}
md_define("Democracy", def = "Government by the people", cat = TRUE)
```

[cm]: https://spec.commonmark.org/
[df]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
[pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists

## Inline

You can also use `gluedown` to format R [inline code results][inline]. First,
use R to calculate a result.

```{r ex_inline}
rand <- sample(state.name, 1)
# `r md_bold(rand)`
```

Then, you can easily print that result in the middle of regular text with
markdown formatting. In this case, our randomly selected state is... 
`r md_bold(rand)`!
