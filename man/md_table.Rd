\details{
From the \href{https://github.github.com/gfm/#table}{GFM spec}: A table is an arrangement of
data with rows and columns, consisting of a single header row, a
\href{https://github.github.com/gfm/#delimiter-row}{delimiter row} separating the
header from the data, and zero or more data rows... Each row consists of cells containing
arbitrary text, in which \href{https://github.github.com/gfm/#inline}{inlines} are parsed,
separated by pipes (\code{|}). A leading and trailing pipe is also recommended for clarity of
reading, and if thereâ€™s otherwise parsing ambiguity. Spaces between pipes and cell content are
trimmed. Block-level elements cannot be inserted in a table. The delimiter row consists of
cells whose only content are hyphens (\code{-}), and optionally, a leading or trailing colon (\code{:}),
or both, to indicate left, right, or center alignment respectively.
